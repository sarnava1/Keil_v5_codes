   1          //the STARTUP.A51 contains instructions to be run when the microcontroller is reset
   2          //steps to write a project in keil:
   3          //1.open it from taskbar or anywhere
   4          //2.from project click on new mewvision project
   5          //3.after that in the desired folder save your new project by giving it a name
   6          //4.after that give your file a suitable name and the extension will be given by them only
   7          //5.after that follow the normal steps
   8          //6.after that click on on new for new file and write the _code there and give it a .c extension.
   9          //7.enjoy coding
