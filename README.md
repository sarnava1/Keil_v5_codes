Let me first give you some intoduction to this. When I was in my sophomre year in college I decided to know more about microcontrollers.
I already had in-depth knowledge of Arduino UNO and Arduino Mega. I had also worked extensively with Raspberry Pi board. So, I decided to
work with 8051 microcontroller. We still have not been taught microcontrollers in our college but we will have it soon in our 6th sem. So,
I acquired all the knowledge of the 8051 microcontroller while doing these small projects. I did five small but practical projects. By 
practical I mean we can easily implement them wherever we like with some moderations.
