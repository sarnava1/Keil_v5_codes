Let me first give you some intoduction to this. When I was in my sophomre year in college I decided to know more about microcontrollers.
I already had in-depth knowledge of Arduino UNO and Arduino Mega. I had also worked extensively with Raspberry Pi board. So, I decided to
work with 8051 microcontroller. We still have not been taught microcontrollers in our college but we will have it soon in our 6th sem. So,
I acquired all the knowledge of the 8051 microcontroller while doing these small projects. I did five small but practical projects. By 
practical I mean we can easily implement them wherever we like with some moderations.

I have done the project using AT89S52 microcontroller. It is a 8051 based microcontroller. It is a microcontroller which was made by Atmel which was sold to Microchip in 2016. All the connections of the projects are given in the respective codes. All the connections are very well explained and easy to understand for any interested person. 

There are 5 projects. They are:

1. The first project is a home automation system. Herein using a mobile app you can switch on/off the lights and fans of your room. It        uses a bluetooth network. The first 2 codes are of this project. RevHomeAuto is also another code for this code. It is for the reverse    logic relays. Relays are of two types: reverse logic and forward logic. So if anyone is using reverse logic relays please use this        code. 

2. The second project is about a smart traffic system. It will replace the traffic policeman at the traffic lights. This system has the 
   capability to deal with all kinds of traffic behaviour in a well mannered traffic intersection where traffic is coming from 4 sides.      All the connections are clearly give in the codes. Remember we can use an unsigned variable to store the states of our pins of a port.
   We can implement this system in a traffic system. Smart Traffic System is the beta version of the final code. Smart Traffic Final is 
   the final and ultimate code. Although I am continuously working for modifications anyone can safely use the code. We have used Passive 
   Infrared Sensor to sense the appearance of vehicles.
   
3. The third project is about a automatic railway crossing wherein we can safely manoevure the movement of trains across unmanned railway
   railway crossings without causing any accidents. Here too we have used PIRs. There can be three cases and all the cases has been          explained in my code very nicely. All connections and all situations are nicely commented and given so that anyone can understand. We      can easily implement such a system in our villages to make our INDIA smart and digital!!!
   
4. The fourth project is an access control system where we are using RFID tags. We will use EM-18 reader module for reading the RFID tags.
   For that we are using putty for communication with my computer. The name of the project is RFIDPROJECT.There are two header files which    I had to write for better understanding of the code. One header file handles the LCD functions and the other header file handles the 
   UART communication with EM-18 reader module. This is a very useful project and we cna implement it anywhere we like. 
   
5. The last project is to make the lightning of the bathroom smart. When there will be no one in the bathroom the light will be off and      when someone will be there the lights will turn on.
