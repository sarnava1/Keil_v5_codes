Let me first give you some intoduction to this. When I was in my sophomre year in college I decided to know more about microcontrollers.
I already had in-depth knowledge of Arduino UNO and Arduino Mega. I had also worked extensively with Raspberry Pi board. So, I decided to
work with 8051 microcontroller. We still have not been taught microcontrollers in our college but we will have it soon in our 6th sem. So,
I acquired all the knowledge of the 8051 microcontroller while doing these small projects. I did five small but practical projects. By 
practical I mean we can easily implement them wherever we like with some moderations.

I have done the project using AT89S52 microcontroller. It is a 8051 based microcontroller. It is a microcontroller which was made by Atmel which was sold to Microchip in 2016. All the connections of the projects are given in the respective codes. All the connections are very well explained and easy to understand for any interested person. 

There are 5 projects. They are:

1. The first project is a home automation system. Herein using a mobile app you can switch on/off the lights and fans of your room. It        uses a bluetooth network. The first 2 codes are of this project. RevHomeAuto is also another code for this code. It is for the reverse    logic relays. Relays are of two types: reverse logic and forward logic. So if anyone is using reverse logic relays please use this        code.
2. The second project is about a smart traffic system. It will replace the traffic policeman at the traffic lights. This system has the 
   capability to deal with all kinds of traffic behaviour in a well mannered traffic intersection where traffic is coming from 4 sides.      All the connections are clearly give in the codes. Remember we can use an unsigned variable to store the states of our pins of a port.
   We can implement this system in a traffic system. Smart Traffic System is the beta version of the final code. Smart Traffic Final is 
   the final and ultimate code. Although I am continuously working for modifications anyone can safely use the code. We have used Passive 
   Infrared Sensor to sense the appearance of vehicles.
